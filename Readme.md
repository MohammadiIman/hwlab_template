### Implementation Details

In this section, we explain how we built the project. We recommend using images to show your system model and implementation steps.

If your project has multiple parts (e.g., server, client, and embedded device), create separate sections for each one.

### How to Run

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. **Build the Project**: Compile the project using the following command:

   ```bash
