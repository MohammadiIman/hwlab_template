# Code

Please upload your final code files to this folder.

If your project has multiple parts (e.g., server, client, and embedded device), create a separate folder for each one.

Edit this *README* file to provide a brief description of each part.

**Example:**

## Server

The server is built using `Django`, a popular web framework for Python. It handles requests from clients and manages data processing.

## Client

The client-side interface is developed with `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. This combination creates a responsive and interactive user experience.

## ESP32

The ESP32 microcontroller is programmed in `C++` using the `Arduino IDE`. This setup allows for efficient handling of hardware interactions and communication protocols.
